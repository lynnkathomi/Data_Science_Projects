Data Science Projects

Overview

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains various projects where I have explored different machine learning models, performed data analysis, and built predictive models using real-world datasets. Each project showcases my ability to clean and preprocess data, engineer features, select appropriate models, and evaluate performance using various metrics.
How to Use

Clone this repository:

Install dependencies:

Navigate to a project folder and run the respective Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

Future Improvements

Enhance model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.

Implement deep learning models for more complex problems.

Deploy selected models as web applications using Flask or FastAPI.
