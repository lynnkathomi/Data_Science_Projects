Data Science Projects

Overview

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains various projects where I have explored different machine learning models, performed data analysis, and built predictive models using real-world datasets. Each project showcases my ability to clean and preprocess data, engineer features, select appropriate models, and evaluate performance using various metrics.
